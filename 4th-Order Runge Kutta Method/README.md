# Numerical-Methods
The program solves the problem of the kind (dy/dx)=-(lambda)*cos(x) and y(X1)=Yo on range [X1,X2]. You can specify the lambda parameter, the X range, and the Yo initial condition. The result is a "calculations.txt" file. The first column is X, the second is the solution given by the Ronge-Kutta method, the third is the analytical solution.
