# Euler-Cauchy Algorithm
This program solves the Cauchy problem using two methods: the Euler method and the Euler-Cauchy method. For each of the methods, two functions are written: the first function finds the solution by this method with a given STEP, and the second function selects the STEP by the given accuracy. The result of the program's work is 4 files - numerical solutions of the Cauchy problem using two methods in two different implementations. In addition, the program displays on the monitor the number of steps taken by the Euler method and the Euler-Cauchy method for comparison.
