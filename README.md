# Numerical-Methods
There are 5 different progects on numerical methods on C/C++.
1. 4th-Order Runge Kutta Method (with list and vector) - program for solving Cauchy problem.
2. 4th-Order Runge Kutta Method - program for solving Cauchy problem.
3. Binary search and Newton's Method - program for solving equals kind of f(x) = 0 (with several conditions)
4. Euler-Cauchy Algorithm - program for solving the Cauchy problem in 2 different ways (I think this is the most complex program there)
5. Integral calculating two methods - program for calculating and comparing integral 2 different ways.
